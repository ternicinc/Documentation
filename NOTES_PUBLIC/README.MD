# Public Notes

This repository contains all publicly available notes and resources, that we use to develop our services. The notes and resources ar divided by the proper classes, for example, server related notes are found within the SERVER directory. Same goes for Operating System, Modules, Compute Cloud, and all the other services we offer or will offer in the future.

Depending on how this goes, we will keep this repository open and publicly available at all times, this is so developers both in software and hardware get the needed schemas, and resources to actually design and create things, around our products.
