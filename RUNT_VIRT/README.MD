# RUNT V Virtualization

Welcome to the RUNT V documentation, within this directory, we will add all the knowledge and tools you need to get started with the RUNT V virtualization manager. Please note that RUNT V is in early development, and is not ready for production. We are currently working on the basic outline, like the IP manager, Network manager in general and of course the storage, instance and user manager.

As stated, we are in very early stages, so please, do NOT use it in production, not without accepting the risks that come with it. A stable release will be published as soon as we think it's ready for it.
